# Test-Driven-Gamedev

A small project that serves only one purpose - showing that creating automated tests for games is not so hard, as people tend to say.

I decided to choose Test-Driven Development, so you can see each step in following commits and get the idea of what is going on by reading messages fpr each commit.
